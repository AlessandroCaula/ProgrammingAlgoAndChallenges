    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we'll use a *depth-first search (DFS) approach* to detect cycles in the course dependency graph. If there's a cycle, it means we can't finish all courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll represent the graph using an adjacency list. Then, we'll perform DFS for each course.\n",
    "During DFS, we'll keep track of visited courses and courses in the current path. If we encounter a course that's already in the current path, we've found a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this solution is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of courses and `E` is the number of prerequisites. That's because we visit each course once and each prerequisite once."
