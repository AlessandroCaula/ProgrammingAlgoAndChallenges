    "### Intuition:\n",
    "To calculate the number of ways to climb the stairs, we can observe that hen we are on the nth stair, we have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. either we climbed one stair from the (n-1)th stair or\n",
    "2. we climbed two stairs from the (n-2)th stair.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging this observation, we can break down the problem into smaller subproblems and apply the concept of the Fibonacci series.  \n",
    "The base cases are when we are on the 1st stair (only one way to reach it) and the 2nd stair (two ways to reach it).   \n",
    "By summing up the number of ways to reach the (n-1) and (n-2)th stairs, we can compute the total number of ways to climb the stairs.   \n",
    "This allows us to solve the problem efficiently using various dynamic programming techniques such as recursion, memoriztion, tabulation, or space optimization. "

    "### Approach 1: Recursion \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exaplanation**: The recursive solution uses the concept of Fibonacci numbers to solbe the problem. It calculates the number of ways to climb the stairs by recursively calling the `climbStairs` unction for (n-1) and (n-2) steps.   \n",
    "However, this solution has exponential time complexity (O(2^n)) due to reduntatn calculations. "

    "The base cases (0 and 1 steps) are initialized to 1 since there is only one way to reach them.    \n",

    "**Explanation**: The space-optimized solution further reduces the space complexity by using only two vatiables (`prev` and `curr`) instead of an entire DP table. It initializes `prev` and `curr` to 1 since there is only one way to reach the base cases (0 and 1 steps). Then, in each iteration, it updates `prev` and `curr` by shifting their values.   \n",
