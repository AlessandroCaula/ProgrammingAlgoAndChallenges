    "# Car Fleet\n",
    "\n",
    "There are `n` cars traveling to the same destination on a one-lane highway.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two arrays of integers `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `position[i]` is the position of the `ith car` (in miles)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `speed[i]` is the speed of the `ith` car (in miles per hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "The __destination__ is at position `target` miles. \n",
    "\n",
    "A car can __not__ pass another car ahead of it. It can only catch up to another car and then drive at the same speed as the car ahead of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __car fleet__ is a non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. A single car is also considered a car fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a car catches up to a car fleet the moment the fleet reaches the destination, then the car is considered to be part of the fleet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Return the number of __different car fleets__ that will arrive at the destination. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "Input: target = 10, position = [1,4], speed = [3,2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "Input: target = 10, position = [4,1,0,7], speed = [2,2,1,1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "_Explanation_: The cars starting at 4 and 7 become a fleet at position 10. The cars starting at 1 and 0 never catch up to the car ahead of them. Thus, there are 3 car fleets that will arrive at the destination. "
