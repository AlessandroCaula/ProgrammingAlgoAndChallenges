    <!-- The Inline Styles in HTML: 
    - Definition: 
        Inline styles are defined directly within the HTML element using the style attribute.
    - Advantages:
        - Quick Application: Easy to use for small, one-off style changes.
        - Overrides External CSS: Inline styles have high specificity and override external or internal CSS unless "!important" is used. 
        - No Extra File Needed: Useful in cases where only minor, specific styling is required.
    - Disadvantages:
        - Hard to Maintain: Difficult to read and update as the project grows.
        - Not Reusable: Styles must be rewritten for each element, leading to redundancy.
        - Cluttered Markup: Mixing content (HtML) with presentation (CSS) violates the principle of separation of concerns.

    <!-- When to use "id" and when to use "class" in the HTML elements for styling in the CSS file -->
    <!-- 
    - Use a CLASS:
        - When to use:
            - Reusable styles: Apply the same styling to multiple elements.
            - Group styling: Style multiple elements in the same way.
        - Why Use a Class:
            - Classes are not unique and can be used on multiple elements. 
            - They make it easier to maintain and scale your styles.
    - Use an ID:
        - When to use:
            - Unique style: Apply a specific style to a single, unique element.
            - Targeting specific elements: For unique components like headers or unique sections of the page.
        - Why use and ID: 
            - IDs must be unique within a page, which ensure precise targeting. 
            - They are useful when styling or scripting single elements.
