## User Name Generator

'''
Write a function called user_name, that creates a username for the user. The function should ask a user to input their name. The function should then reverse the name and attach a randomly issued number between 0 â€“ 9 at the end of the name. 
The function should return the username. 
'''

import random

def user_name():
    name = input("Insert your name: ")
    user = name[::-1]
    user += str(random.randint(0, 9))
    return user

print(user_name())
